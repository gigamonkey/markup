Markup is a text markup language primarily useful for prose documents
such as books and articles. It is designed to be editable in a plain
text editor and to allow for arbitrary logical markup.

The grammar of a Markup file is defined in terms of a mapping to an
abstract syntax tree which can then be rendered into a number of
formats, e.g. HTML, PDF, TeX, RTF, etc.

It has been used to produce two books (Practical Common Lisp and
Coders at Work) and
