[This is a work in progress of a new implementation. It getting close
to being ready for use. Oh, and this is the first Ruby code I've ever
written so if it looks stupid, that might be why. Comments welcome.]

Markup is a text markup language primarily useful for prose documents
such as books and articles. It is designed to be editable in a plain
text editor and to allow for arbitrary logical markup.

The grammar of a Markup file is defined in terms of a mapping to an
abstract syntax tree which can then be rendered into a number of
formats, e.g. HTML, PDF, TeX, RTF, etc.

The full specificiation of Markup is in markup-spec.txt (which is
itself written in Markup). See also [1] for a Common Lisp
implementation that evolved out of the one I used while working on my
two books, Practical Common Lisp and Coders at Work, both of which
were written in Markup.
