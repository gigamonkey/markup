[N.B. This is a work in progress of a new implementation. Not yet
ready for use.]

Markup is a text markup language primarily useful for prose documents
such as books and articles. It is designed to be editable in a plain
text editor and to allow for arbitrary logical markup.

The grammar of a Markup file is defined in terms of a mapping to an
abstract syntax tree which can then be rendered into a number of
formats, e.g. HTML, PDF, TeX, RTF, etc.

This project will contain implementations of Markup processors in
various languages. See also [1] for a Common Lisp implementation that
evolved out of the one I used while working on my two books, Practical
Common Lisp and Coders at Work, both of which were written in Markup.
